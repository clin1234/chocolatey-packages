# Selection of Chocolatey Packages

The `test` directory provides a dummy example of how to create a Chocolatey
package, generated by `choco new test`.

Currently, the following packages are offered:
* [equation-gcc-snapshot](equation-gcc-snapshot): Toolchain containing prebuilt
weekly snapshot of GCC (only C, C++, and Fortran compilers), make, binutils, 
and gdb for Windows.
